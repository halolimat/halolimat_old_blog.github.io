Currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [Wright State University][wsu] and working as part of the research team at The Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing ([Kno.e.sis][knoesis]). My current research is focused on [Natural Language Processing][nlp], [Information Retrieval][ir], and [Knoweldge Extraction][ke].

Previously, received MSc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Toledo][ut]. My research and thesis work was focused on Multi-level Optimization of Wireless Sensor Networks and Cloud-based Systems through the development of [Metaheuristics][metah] (mainly using [Bio-Inspired Computing][biocom]).

Before joining the masters program at UT, I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from the [German Jordanian University][gju].
