Currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [Wright State University][wsu] advised by [Dr. Amit Sheth][sheth] and working as part of the research team at The Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing ([Kno.e.sis][knoesis]).

Kno.e.sis performs world-class research on translating information to meaning, towards the vision of Computing for Human Experience ([video][video]). My research is focused on [Semantic Web][semanticWeb], Semantic Applications ([a story by my advisor][story]), and [Social Computing][socComp].

Previously, received MSc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Toledo][ut] advised by the EECS department chair [Dr. Mansoor Alam][alam] and Co-Advised by [Dr. Robert Green][green]. My research and thesis work was focused on Multi-level Optimization of Wireless Sensor Networks and Cloud-based Systems through the development of [Metaheuristics][metah] (mainly using [Bio-Inspired Computing][biocom]).

Before joining the masters program at UT, I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from the [German Jordanian University][gju] advised by [Dr. Christina Class][class]. My love of semantic applications started when I finished my senior design in May, 2012. The project exposed me to the beauty of [Semantics][sem] and the powers of [Open/Linked Data][lod].
